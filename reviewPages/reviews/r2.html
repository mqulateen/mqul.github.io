        <div class="container">
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">
                    <p>I’ve had my fair share of action camera’s and that has put me in a place to tell them apart when using them. Being completely honest, this camera - the EX5000 - feels like the most polished of the 3 that I have tested; that's in both software and hardware. The exterior of all the action cameras that I have encountered are similar - only difference I've noticed is that the EX5000 outputs sound through its forward facing speaker grill.</p>

                    <p>The box does include some mounting clips and a water proof case but it doesn’t end there. You can get yourself a go pro accessories kit, and literally record whatever you are doing. Other than the various mounting brackets and the camera itself, the box includes an instructions manual, a micro USB charging cable, microfibre cleaning cloth, a metal string with 3M sticky tape, zip ties, and velcro bandages.
                    With the water proofing case on, the camera can be submerged up to 30M. The most I’ve done for now was fill my sink with water to test it. It works
                    well but since the case completely seals the camera in, the mic doesn’t pick up sound.
                    Moving on, the camera has a pre-installed 900mAh battery which captures a decent amount of footage - what makes it last a little longer is the dimming feature that turns the screen off after a few seconds into recording. There is an additional back-up 900mAh battery included which can be swapped out with the main battery.</p>

                    <p>What I like most about the camera, is the optical image stabilisation feature. Prior to getting my hands on this camera, my iPhone 6 was the device I primarily used for recording. With its lack of OIS and my shaky hands, the videos turned out terrible. So when I recorded with this camera for the first
                    time, I was pleasantly surprised by the stability. The UI is clean and easy to understand and navigate, same can be said for the 4 buttons around the device. Other notable features of the camera include the ability to record at full HD, its wide angle lens - gives a panorama view, the mini HDMI port - used for playback directly to your TV, the 2 inch display - great for navigating the menus/watching playbacks/acting as a view finder, and the WIFI connectivity - allows you to begin capturing videos and images directly from your smart-phone with a companion app such as "FinalCam" on iOS.</p>
