                <p> I decided to unfollow the tradition review style with this one. I tested the projector over a week and made bullet points of my findings.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>The projector comes with a very simple OS that should be easy to navigate for all.</li>
                        <li>Built in video player that allows multiple functions including play/pause, forward/rewind - it has also been compatible with all video files that I’ve tested: mkv and mp4 to name some.</li>
                        <li>There is an interface to update the software over the air via Wifi, this was the first thing I done after first boot - there was an update available.</li>
                        <li>Under settings, you are given the ability to adjust the projectors brightness - 2 options “high” and “low” and language.</li>
                        <li>OS contains clear instructions on how to connect to all compatible devices</li>
                        <li>Setting up Wifi on the projector was also very clear - the wifi setup is very similar to how the Google chromecast setups up a wifi connection.</li>
                        <li>Surprised that the projector was able to achieve over 100 inches at such a compact size - bare in mind that the room must be extremely dark at that size but it was still capable.</li>
                        <li>Not exactly a problem with the device but, the protocols used to connect to the device are wifi based. I attempted to connect to the projector using my PC with a wired connection but it did not pick the device up until I connected my PC via wifi.</li>
                        <li>I haven’t noticed any latency between devices but this can be completely dependant on your wireless speed/router.</li>
                        <li>After fully charging the battery - I was able to get a total of around 3.5 hours (4:23pm - 7:53pm) use from the device before it died. This included watching a movie and streaming my iPad for the remaining time.</li>
                        <li>Due to the size of my room, I mostly used the device at around 65 inches - I was able to view most images during the day (with curtains closed) but black images/scenes were hard to see.</li>
                        <li>The remote is very useful, it has quick access buttons so navigating between modes is a breeze.</li>
                        <li>The projector is advertised as 60” @ 1.66m, I was able to achieve 56.5” @ 1.52m (5ft) you are pretty much getting what was advertised.</li>
                        <li>There is an accessories box in the compartment below the projector - it comes with a white micro usb cable and a UK charing plug that emits a green LED when turned on. There is also the remote and tripod that extends up to 9”.</li>
                        <li>The built-in speaker is not too great, sounds muffled. An external speaker is a must if you’re watch/listening to media on the device. This is expected due to the small size of the device.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Overall, very impressive device for its compact and sleek design. It has professional packaging and includes all necessary equipment for use. I found the image quality to be very good while watching movies. I was able to watch a football match with my curtain partly opened - dark scenes are a little hard to see if the room is not completely dark.</p>
