<h1>DS Privacy Policy</h1>
<h2>I DO NOT COLLECT ANY DATA WHEN USING MY APP.</h2>

<h3>I physically can not as I have nowhere to store it. All information gathered by the application is stored locally ON the device. I do not even have a server database to store it. So even if the Queen asked nicely to see your data, I would not have anything to show her.
<br /><br/>
Whatever you used Diary Scheduler to do on your phone, stays on your phone.</h3>
